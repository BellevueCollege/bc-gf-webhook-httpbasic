# BC Gravity Forms Webhook Basic Auth Add-On

This simple WordPress plugin is an add-on to an add-on; The excellent [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) plugin provides a [premium add-on to allow webhook support](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/webhooks/), but the functionality of this plugin does not include HTTP Basic authentication against API endpoints. 

This plugin adds this functionality. It adds a new Form Settings panel which allows you add basic auth to all defined webhook feeds.

Ideally this plugin would allow per-feed auth (instead of per-form auth). Feel free to submit a pull request if this is something would would like!
